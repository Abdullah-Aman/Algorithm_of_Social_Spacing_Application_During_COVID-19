# Algorithm_of_Social_Spacing_Application_During_COVID-19
This project was implemented during the summer training period for the year 2020 at (Smart Methods) Company and the property rights are reserved for them.

# Project idea:
Algorithm_of_Social_Spacing_Application_During_COVID-19.

# Project description:

The earth lives in a state of panic regarding the new corona virus, which constitutes a threat to human life. This is an algorithm that helps in building programs that help implement social spacing, which helps to reduce the spread of this epidemic. A specific process is as follows:


- Start

(1) In this step, the alarm will be closed immediately if when system is started, and this step has links to other steps that I will explain later.

(2) In this step, the signals will be captured and MAC Addresses data will be recorded for those who are around the person with close contacts.

(3) In this step, the number of contacts will be recorded based on the number of closed MAC Addresses.

(4) In this step, the number of contacts whose data has been recorded (n) will be verified if(n>=10), the system will continue recording and the signals will be captured if the number was less than 10, but if the number is grater or equal to 10, then the next step will be moved (turn on alarm).

(5) In this step, the alarm will be triggered if the number of closed contacts exceeds 10.

(6) In this step, the data of the owners of the MAC Addresses that was recorded by picking up signals previously will be sent to the databases.

(7) In this step, a message will be sent to the people whose presence was recorded in the place where the signals were captured in case that they had contact with COVID-19 patient.

- End
